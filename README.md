## IIT Delhi Proxy login script


### Why?
_why, of all the infinite possible reasons, was this made?_  

There were days, when I had to ssh into a server, and when I need to download something, I had to download it locally , scp it to server, and this irked me enough to get my lazy self to write a script. Does what it says on the tin. 

###What?
_what, of all the infinite possible actions, does this do?_  

This is a simple python script, that asks for your proxy category, userid, and password, and logs you in to the proxy servers.

###How?
_how, of all the infinite possible ways, should I use it?_  

Run it. Or eat it for dinner.
P.S: You'll need python3.x

###Trust?
_can you be trusted? What if you are stealing my passwords?_  

Good Lord!! Read the source. If you are lazy enough not to read the source, and skeptic enough not to trust, maintain a distance of 2.45 meters from my code.

###Legal?
_can I copy this?_  

This is my intellectual property, original creation, and is copylefted. Use it for anything, but be warned that I am not liable, in any way, for any misuse, real or perceived, of this code.
